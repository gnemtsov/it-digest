# IT Digest

IT Digest is a small personal tool that collects and summarizes top Reddit discussions from select programming-related subreddits.

The goal is to help stay updated on interesting conversations in frontend and software development spaces, by creating weekly digest-style summaries. These digests link back to the original Reddit posts and are used for personal reference and optional sharing.

## Features

- Fetches top posts from Redditâ€™s public API (via OAuth)
- Extracts titles, post bodies, and top-level comments
- Uses GPT for generating short summaries
- Optionally formats content for Telegram

## Usage

This script is for personal use only. It runs once a day from a private server, collects data from Reddit using an authenticated Reddit app, and generates summaries for private use or sharing with a small developer community.

## License

This project is not licensed for commercial use and is not intended to redistribute Reddit data at scale. All summaries link back to the original Reddit threads.
